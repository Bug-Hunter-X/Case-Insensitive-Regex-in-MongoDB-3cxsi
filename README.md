This repository demonstrates a potential issue with case-insensitive regular expressions in MongoDB queries. The `bug.js` file shows a query that intends to perform a case-insensitive search using the `/i` flag. However, this flag's behavior can be unpredictable in certain contexts. The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution to ensure case-insensitive search regardless of the MongoDB version.
